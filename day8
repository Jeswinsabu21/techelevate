day 8

Today, I successfully developed and tested a graphical user interface (GUI) for my Python-based firewall using Tkinter.
 The goal was to make the firewall more interactive and user-friendly by displaying live traffic, toggling firewall rules, and viewing logs.
Tasks Completed:
    Developed a Tkinter-based GUI for the personal firewall project.
    Implemented a Live Packet Viewer using Treeview to display time, source IP, destination IP, and protocol.
    Created a Firewall Rules section with checkboxes to enable/disable:
        Block ICMP
        Block TCP port 80
    Added an Apply Rules button to reflect rule status in the log.
    Integrated a Log Viewer using ScrolledText to show blocked packets and rule activity.
    Used Scapy to sniff network packets and apply filtering logic based on selected rules.
    Utilized after() method with threading to periodically update packet capture without freezing the GUI.
